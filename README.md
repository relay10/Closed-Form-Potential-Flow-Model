# Closed-Form-Potential-Flow-Model
In this work, we provide a broad unifying view generative models, relating them as probability transports driven by vector fields. We derive a Closed-Form Flow Model (CFFM) under this framework that specifies a time-inhomogeneous energy function with analytical gradients.
